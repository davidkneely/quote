# quote
A unix/linux command line utility that shows a quote from a quotes.txt file on your computer.
## Instructions to use:
1. Determine where you want your quotes to be. I put them in my Documents folder. Let's call it quotesDirectory.
2. Add the following lines to your .bashrc file
3. Replace /home/david/Documents/ with your quotesDirectory.
```
# Quotes
alias quote='bash /home/david/Documents/quote.sh'
```
